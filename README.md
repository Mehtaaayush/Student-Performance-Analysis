Student Performance Analysis
This repository contains my internship project for Maincrafts Technology, focused on analyzing student performance data using Python.

Overview
This project analyzes a dataset containing student grades and demographic information. The goal is to draw insights about student achievement, study habits, and other factors influencing academic performance. The analysis covers:

Average final grade calculation

Count of high-performing students

Correlation between study time and grades

Comparison of average grades by gender

Visualizations including histogram, scatterplot, and bar chart

Files
Student_Performance_Analysis.ipynb: Main Jupyter notebook with all code, analysis, and visualizations.

student-mat.csv: Student dataset (if included).

Supporting files as needed.
